## Documentation

#### Mandatory

The Goal of the project is to create a small program that will present an endless run (within the school walls, to match the cover story) in 3D, using a similar gameplay as in “Temple run”. The program needs at least to show the following elements:

- A set with a cool perspective.
- A set that moves forward to give an impression of movement.
- A randomly generated set using a limited number of 3D elements and obstacles glued all together.
- A set inspired by the architectural elements of your campus.
- A character that stays in the foreground, and that can move laterally and jump.
- Obstacles to avoid, and to jump over, otherwise the game stops.
- A distance meter.


#### Bonus
- A particularly cool set.
- Joy (Campus Dog) to be picked-up in addition to the obstacles to avoid.
- Some power-ups to be picked-up that give special abilities or protections.
- Specific missions or quests to complete.
- Slide under some obstacles that are higher.
- Different characters with different skills.
- All sorts of add-ons that exist in these type of games.
